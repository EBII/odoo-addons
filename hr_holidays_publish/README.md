[ DESCRIPTION ]

By default, Odoo only allows employees to see their own leaves. This is not practical within a company as employee's holidays have to be be combined.
By not being able to know about other's requests, employees have to go through HR in what might be a frustrating process.
With this module, each employee has the chance of letting others know about his leaves, thus contributing to the transparency and easyness inside the company.
